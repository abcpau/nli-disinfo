            "fake - The premise does not provide any information about the number of killings or arrests before July 1, nor does it suggest that there were attempts to purge everybody before Duterte's inauguration. In fact, it only provides data from July 1 to November 29, which supports Duterte's claim that legitimate operations began after his inauguration.\n",
            "fact - The premise explicitly states that \"project Double Barrel... was launched on July 1, a day after Duterte's inauguration\" and that it was launched through a Command Memorandum Circular signed by PNP Chief Ronald de la Rosa himself, which aligns with the hypothesis. Additionally, the premise mentions that page 3 of the document reads: “this cmc will be launched and implemented on the first day of office of the cpnp.”, further supporting the fact that the campaign was indeed launched on July 1.\n",
            "fake - The premise clearly states that CHR is an independent agency created as a fact-finding and recommendatory body, which means it does not have the authority to file cases on its own. It can only assist complainants of human rights violations and forward its findings to pertinent government agencies for prosecution. Secretary Aguirre's statement contradicts this established fact about CHR's capabilities.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that CHR can only assist complainants of human rights violations and cannot file cases on its own, whereas Gascon's statement implies that DOJ can act independently of CHR and file charges without CHR's involvement, which contradicts the premise.\n",
            "fake - The premise does not support Duterte's claim that Alston's investigation had \"no result\". In fact, the premise states that Alston came up with two reports in 2008 and 2009, which suggests that his investigation did have a result. Additionally, the premise mentions that Alston calculated roughly half of murders in Davao were committed by the DDS, implying that Alston's findings had some impact on understanding human rights violations in the country.\n",
            "fake - The premise describes Alston's reports and findings, but the hypothesis quotes Alston directly from his 2008 report. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the hypothesis is actually a paraphrased or summarized version of Alston's statements, rather than an exact quote. This suggests that the hypothesis may not be entirely accurate or faithful to Alston's original words.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that the EDCA was signed by former National Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin for the Philippine government and US Ambassador Philip Goldberg for the U.S. government, which directly contradicts President Duterte's claim that it was only signed by an aide at Gazmin.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that the EDCA was signed by Gazmin according to the Philippines' procedure in negotiating and ratifying agreements, which implies that the President's signature was required for agreements of a permanent character. However, the hypothesis claims that Gazmin is the authorized representative of former President Aquino, which would exempt the agreement from requiring the President's signature. This contradicts the premise's implication that the President's signature was necessary.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that Duterte arrived from Jakarta on September 30, after attending the Asean summit in Laos on September 10. However, the hypothesis claims that Duterte came home from Laos on an unspecified date (but presumably around September 10), which contradicts the premise's timeline.\n",
            "fake - The premise does not mention President Duterte making a statement about migrants or Hitler, nor does it imply any connection between his visit schedule and the hypothesis. The hypothesis appears to be unrelated to the information provided in the premise.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that the DILG is not part of the vetting process and only follows through with listings released by the President, whereas the hypothesis implies that Duterte instructed the DILG to validate and review the list before giving it to someone else. This contradicts the premise's statement about the DILG's role in the process.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that the DILG is not part of the vetting process and only follows through the listing released by the President, whereas Undersecretary John Castriciones claims that they are not a party to the validation and only give recommendations on actions against narco-politicians. This directly contradicts the premise's statement about the DILG's role in the process.\n",
            "fake - The premise presents statistics showing a decrease in poverty incidence and unemployment rate during the Aquino administration, which contradicts Salgado's statement that \"poverty remains a serious problem today\" and that millions remained poor and jobless despite economic growth.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that poverty incidence went down at the national level, but the hypothesis claims it rose in six regions and 24 provinces, which contradicts the initial statement.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that Duterte's biggest donor is Antonio Floirendo Jr., who contributed a total of P100 million, while the hypothesis claims that only 1 or 2 people (including Imee) supported him with no mention of any significant donors. This contradicts the information provided in the premise.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that Marcos' name does not appear among the 183 donors listed by Duterte and his party, but Marcos denies any contribution to Duterte's campaign, saying it was solely to solicit votes for him in the Ilocos region. This directly contradicts the premise, which implies that Marcos made a significant donation (P100 million) to Duterte's campaign through Antonio Floirendo Jr.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that Duterte's name is not on the list of BSFS graduates, which contradicts his claim in the hypothesis that he graduated from the Foreign Service.\n",
            "fact - The premise directly supports the hypothesis, showing that Duterte's name is not in the BSFS roster of the same document where his BA graduation was confirmed.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that Republic Act No. 9165 defines drug dependence as a medical condition, using the World Health Organization's definition, which implies that President Duterte's views on drug addiction contradict this established fact. His statement in his arrival speech from Japan suggests that he does not consider drug addiction to be a medical problem, which directly contradicts the premise.\n",
            "fake - The premise defines drug dependence as a medical condition based on the World Health Organization's definition, whereas the hypothesis defines drug addiction as a complex brain disease. Although both definitions are related to substance use disorders, they have distinct characteristics and connotations. The premise focuses on the physiological, behavioral, and cognitive phenomena of variable intensity associated with drug dependence, whereas the hypothesis emphasizes excessive craving, seeking, and use characteristic of addiction. Furthermore, the resolution mentioned in the hypothesis suggests a treatment approach that implies a distinction between dependence and addiction.\n",
            "fake - The premise does not mention anything about widows of former presidents being entitled to be buried at the Libingan ng Mga Bayani, but Senator Manny Pacquiao's statement implies that they are. This contradicts the regulation listed in the premise.\n",
            "fake - The premise provides a specific regulation issued by the AFP that explicitly lists down categories of deceased persons entitled to be buried at the Libingan ng Mga Bayani, including \"former presidents\", which directly contradicts the hypothesis that the Constitution does not allow former presidents to be buried there.\n",
            "fake - The premise explicitly acknowledges the atrocities committed during Marcos' rule and recognizes the heroism and sacrifices of victims, which directly contradicts President Duterte's statement that \"part of the sins of Marcos\" have yet to be proven.\n",
            "fact - The premise explicitly mentions that the Supreme Court acknowledged the atrocities committed during Marcos' rule (in the 1989 ruling), and Republic Act No. 10368 institutionalizes recognition of human rights violations committed during his regime, which includes various forms of abuse listed in the hypothesis. This directly supports the idea that human rights violations under Marcos have been discussed in court rulings and institutionalized by law.\n",
            "fake - The premise discusses various films that critique the Marcos regime and martial law years in the Philippines, while the hypothesis refers to President Duterte's statement about his own presidency, implying a comparison between himself and Marcos. However, there is no mention or implication of any film being made about Duterte's presidency in the premise, making it neutral to the hypothesis.\n",
            "fact - The premise explicitly states that \"some of the best filipino movies are about the martial law years\" and mentions specific titles, such as \"batch '81\", \"sister stella l\", and \"scorpio nights\". It also mentions that movies about the martial law years are still being made after the 1986 people power movement.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that Duterte says declaring martial law would be \"kalokohan\" (foolish), which contradicts the hypothesis where Duterte is quoted as saying he might declare martial law if his powers are not respected.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that Duterte says declaring martial law would be \"kalokohan\" (foolish), which directly contradicts the hypothesis where Duterte is quoted as saying he would consider declaring martial law, but only if it's necessary to kill all members of the Maute group and religious extremists.\n",
            "fake - The premise shows that Duterte has made contradictory statements about the Abu Sayyaf Group, sometimes sympathizing with them and at other times condemning their brutality. This inconsistency suggests that his statement about not having talks is likely a reaction to one of these instances, but it does not necessarily reflect a consistent stance on the matter.\n",
            "fake - The premise describes Duterte's inconsistent statements regarding the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), sometimes condemning them and other times sympathizing with their cause. However, the hypothesis suggests that Duterte is open to talking to the ASG and even extending an olive branch in friendship, which contradicts his previous contradictory statements about the group.\n",
            "fake - The premise does not provide any information that would suggest Duterte's stomach condition or his need for a bathroom, which is what he claims in the hypothesis.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that Duterte skipped the gala dinner and photo shoot to avoid Obama, while the hypothesis claims he attended the meetings but avoided Obama due to potential awkwardness. These two statements contradict each other regarding Duterte's actions during the APEC meeting in Peru.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that Duterte \"seems to have shifted his tone\" after launching an expletive-laden attack on the EU, but the provided quote suggests that he is still using strong language and making aggressive statements against the EU, which contradicts the idea of a shift in tone.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that Duterte \"seems to have shifted his tone\", implying a change from an aggressive stance to a more conciliatory one, but the hypothesis suggests a statement that is actually quite positive and enthusiastic about being part of Europe. This contradicts the idea of a shift in tone towards a more negative or aggressive stance.\n",
            "fake - The premise explicitly states that human rights violations committed during Marcos' regime have been discussed and institutionalized in several high court rulings, which directly contradicts Duterte's claim that \"part of the sins of Marcos\" have yet to be proven by a competent court.\n",
            "fake - The statement by Duterte implies that victims of Marcos' rule have not yet had an opportunity to seek justice, which contradicts the premise that victims have been going to court to sue the dictator and his family for years.\n",
            "fake - The premise suggests that the Office of the President was informed about the burial ahead of time and took steps to send flowers, which implies a level of involvement or knowledge. However, Duterte's statement claims he had no knowledge of the burial plans and simply allowed it to happen without any input. This creates a contradiction between the two statements.\n",
            "fact - The premise directly states that the Office of the President was informed about the possible burial dates, which led to the preparation of a flower arrangement with Duterte's name, indicating that the President was indeed aware of the burial ahead of time. This is consistent with the statements from Dela Rosa and Padilla, who also claimed that the President was kept informed of everything happening in the country.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that Duterte said he would never be \"foolish\" enough to commit errors on his narco-lists, but the next day he apologized for a mistake done either through negligence or in bad faith. This directly contradicts his initial statement, as it implies that he did indeed make an error.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that Duterte said he would \"never be 'foolish' enough to commit errors on his narco-lists\", but the hypothesis shows him apologizing for a mistake and acknowledging that he was negligent in counter-checking. This contradicts the initial statement, as it implies that he is capable of making mistakes, which goes against his earlier claim of never being \"foolish\" enough to do so.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that Duterte is \"waffling on yet another promise\", implying that he has made promises in the past but failed to deliver, which contradicts his statement in the hypothesis where he guarantees a clean government.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that Duterte seems to be waffling on his promise to stamp out scalawags in public office, but the hypothesis suggests that he has been trying to minimize corruption instead of stopping it entirely. This is a contradictory statement, as minimizing corruption does not necessarily mean stopping it.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that Duterte said cussing was part of his \"political strategy\", which contradicts the hypothesis where he says he has to tone down on cursing as president.\n",
            "fake - The premise only mentions that Duterte's statements often came with cusswords, but it does not specify that he cursed and took a potshot at the US, EU, and UN during an interview with Jessica Soho just after the elections.\n",
            "fake - The premise does not mention Father Fiel Pareja or any connection to the Vatican, nor does it imply that holy water is being promoted as a cure for the mentioned diseases. It actually contradicts the idea of drinking holy water by stating \"hindi po iniinom ang holy water\" (holy water should not be drunk).\n",
            "fake - The premise does not provide any information about the video's authenticity or manipulation, nor does it contradict the hypothesis that the video has \"substantial evidence of manipulation\" in faces, voices, and semantics. In fact, the premise is a statement from a person (pareja) who claims to have been interviewed in the video, which could be related to the manipulated content described in the hypothesis.\n",
            "fake - The premise directly contradicts the hypothesis by providing evidence that the link does not lead to the DOST website or any official government website, but rather to a blog with misleading information and requests for personal data, which is inconsistent with the claim of applying for the DOST scholarship program.\n",
            "fake - The premise contradicts the hypothesis by providing evidence that the link is not an official government website or scholarship application form, but rather a blog with misleading information and requests for personal data, which is inconsistent with the official announcement on the DOST Facebook page.\n",
            "fake - The premise directly contradicts the hypothesis by stating that having a PhilSys ID and/or being registered does not automatically make an individual eligible for cash benefits from the government, which includes social protection programs like the one described in the hypothesis.\n",
            "fact - The premise directly contradicts the hypothesis by stating that PhilSys issued an official statement refuting claims and warning against misleading information, which implies that there are individuals or entities spreading false information about government programs, including those related to PhilSys. This suggests that some accounts may be affiliated with these entities, making it likely that the account promoting the fake program is indeed affiliated with PhilSys or the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).\n",
            "fake - The premise does not provide any information about the DSWD posting a link to CHED's scholarship program, nor does it imply that they would do so. It only clarifies that a fake page is spreading misinformation and using the DSWD's identity without permission.\n",
            "fake - The premise only confirms that the page is fake and unrelated to DSWD, but it doesn't provide information about the content of the post or the link it shares. It's possible that the post was made by a legitimate page that got hacked or compromised, or that the supposed application link leads to a government website but not the official CHED one. The premise only talks about the fake nature of the page and its connection to DSWD, but doesn't provide any information about the content of the post or the link it shares.\n",
            "fake - The premise directly contradicts the hypothesis by stating that there have been no reports from reputable news or government agencies, as well as no announcements from the defense departments of the involved countries to support the claim of a fight between the three nations. This suggests that the alleged incident did not occur.\n",
            "fake - The premise directly contradicts the hypothesis by stating that there have been no reports or announcements from reputable sources regarding a fight between the three countries, which is inconsistent with the reported tensions and incidents mentioned in the hypothesis.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that there is no recent post from DSWD Region 5 concerning Camarines Sur's ranking, but the hypothesis claims that such a post was recently published as a clarification. This contradicts the information provided in the premise.\n",
            "fake - The premise does not provide any information about the content or accuracy of Asintado's citation, nor does it imply that DSWD Region 5's clarification is related to the PSA's release of poverty statistics on December 17, 2021. The premise only discusses the publication date of a post by DSWD Region 5 and its relation to the archived version on WayBack Machine.\n",
            "fake - The premise directly contradicts the hypothesis by stating that there is no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccine causes cancer or inactivates genes that suppress tumors, specifically mentioning the p53 gene as a tumor suppressor gene.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that there is no evidence of the COVID-19 vaccine causing cancer or affecting tumor suppression genes, which contradicts the hypothesis stating that a study found spike proteins in COVID-19 vaccines affect the p53 gene, potentially leading to cancer. However, the premise also mentions that the study does not provide proof that the COVID-19 vaccine causes cancer and that such a conclusion is \"overinterpreting preliminary data.\" This nuance suggests that the premise might be neutral or even supportive of the hypothesis, but the initial contradiction remains.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that WHO declared MPox as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), but does not mention it being a global pandemic, which is a different classification from PHEIC. A PHEIC declaration implies a high level of concern and need for international coordination, but does not necessarily mean the outbreak has reached pandemic levels.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that the WHO assesses whether an event constitutes a PHEIC based on several factors, including the severity of the public health risk, the potential for international spread, and the need for coordinated global interventions. However, this does not necessarily imply that these factors are distinct from those used to determine a pandemic. In fact, the premise suggests that a PHEIC is a key step towards declaring a pandemic, as it implies a significant public health risk with potential for international spread. Therefore, the hypothesis that a PHEIC is considerably different from a pandemic is not supported by the given information.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that there are no official reports indicating Quiboloy's death, which contradicts the hypothesis that he has indeed died.\n",
            "fake - The premise does not mention anything about an arrest operation on August 24, 2024, or any specific details about the events described in the hypothesis. It only mentions that the Philippine National Police has yet to locate and arrest Quiboloy, which is consistent with the hypothesis but does not confirm it as a fact.\n",
            "fake - The premise does not mention anything about drug testing or its relation to the President's decision to skip APEC, and instead provides a clear reason for his absence: prioritizing domestic concerns due to calamities.\n",
            "fake - The premise provides a clear and credible explanation for Marcos' decision to skip APEC, citing domestic concerns and calamity response as the reason. This directly contradicts the hypothesis that Marcos is skipping APEC because he doesn't want to take a drug test, which is based on an unverified claim from a vlogger with no credible sources.\n",
            "fake - The premise does not provide any information about Super Typhoon Rolly or Severe Tropical Storm Kristine, nor does it mention anything about their respective impacts on the population. It only discusses general factors that affect the degree of potential impacts of any weather hazard.\n",
            "fake - The premise explicitly states that there are three key factors affecting the degree of potential impacts of any weather hazard, but it does not mention wind speed as one of them. In fact, it implies that other factors like magnitude, duration, and extent of the hazard, exposed elements, and vulnerability of those elements play a role in determining the impact of a tropical cyclone, which is consistent with the hypothesis that wind speed is not the sole factor.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that recruitment announcements and online application forms are only posted on its official website, https://jointhearmy.ph/, but the hypothesis mentions filling out an online application form through a link provided in several social media posts, which contradicts the premise's requirement for official website posting.\n",

There is no mention of an ad with a link to \"fda-ph.net\", so it cannot be inferred that this specific ad exists.\n",

It only mentions that the product is not on the Philippine FDA's list, but this fact alone does not imply anything about the official Facebook page of the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) or its likes and followers.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that Clear Sight Eye Drops is not registered with the Philippine Food and Drug Administration, which contradicts the hypothesis that Dr. Liza Ramoso-Ong endorses this product. If it were indeed endorsed by her, one would expect it to be registered with the FDA.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that the product Clear Sight Eye Drops is endorsed by Willie Ong, but it also mentions Liza's only official endorsement as Birch Tree Advance. This implies that Liza might have mentioned or endorsed Clear Sight Eye Drops, which contradicts the hypothesis that she does not mention it anywhere.\n",
            "fake - The premise does not support the hypothesis that Dr. Willie Ong uses Anahaw Healing Oil to cure his illness, as it only discusses the ad's authenticity and the product's registration status, without mentioning Dr. Ong's personal use of the product or any health issues he may have.\n",
            "fake - The premise already states that the ad consists of spliced videos and AI-generated audio to make it seem like Ong mentioned the product, but it does not mention anything about removing parts of Ong's original voice recording or replacing them with AI-generated audio. The hypothesis is a repetition of itself, which suggests it might be an assumption rather than a fact supported by the premise.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that the Malaysian Health Ministry, via its official X account, clarified that the statements in the article were not issued or authorized by the government, which contradicts the hypothesis that the Malaysian government published a Facebook post advising the public not to listen to a specific song.\n",

In fact, it states that Marcos failed to substantiate his allegations of massive anomalies and irregularities in Robredo's favor, which suggests that there was no significant cheating involved. The manual recount even increased Robredo's votes by 15,093, further supporting the legitimacy of her victory.\n",

However, President Duterte's statement implies that he believes being 71 years old automatically qualifies him for release, which contradicts the actual provisions of the law. The Revised Penal Code does not state that a person is automatically released or exempt from liability simply because they are over 70 years old; rather, it provides for pardon and release under specific circumstances, such as completion of sentence or good conduct.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that being over 70 is a circumstance that may mitigate criminal liability and lead to pardon, whereas the hypothesis suggests that being 70 only reduces the penalty by 1-2 degrees lower.

            "fact - The 1987 constitution's non-retention of the provision granting the President immunity from suit, combined with Article 27 of the Rome Statute stating that immunities or special procedural rules shall not bar the ICC from exercising its jurisdiction over a person, including the head of state or government, directly supports Harry Roque's statement that the principle of state immunity granted to a sitting president is \"not an effective shield against the ICC.\"\n",
            "fake - The premise does not mention Duterte saying that De Lima should be punished or sued for making a threat against the life of a resource person. Instead, it quotes De Lima as saying that about Duterte's statement.\n",
            "fake - The premise does not contradict the hypothesis, but rather supports it by showing that De Lima indeed found Duterte's statement disturbing and emphasized the importance of following the rule of law.

            "fake - The premise does not mention any of the officials listed in the hypothesis, except for Jed Mabilog being referred to as \"I think he's the mayor\" which is an uncertain statement and does not confirm his position. The rest of the officials mentioned in the hypothesis are not mentioned at all in the premise.\n",
            "fake - The premise actually supports the hypothesis that Iloilo's ranking in terms of drug-affected barangays and other metrics does not match President Duterte's claim that it is the province or city where shabu use is most prevalent, as it ranks lower than many other places (e.g. NCR cities, Cebu).\n",
            "fake - The premise states that Russia imposes a flat tax rate of 13%, but Greco Belgica mentions a \"10 percent flat rate\" which is different from the Russian tax system. This inconsistency suggests that his statement about implementing a flat tax system in the Philippines may not be based on factual knowledge, but rather an attempt to emulate other countries' policies without necessarily understanding their specifics.\n",
            "fact - The premise directly states that Russia has a flat tax rate of 13%, while China has a progressive tax system with rates ranging from 3% to 45%. This matches the hypothesis exactly, making it a fact.\n",

Additionally, the premise presents a mixed picture on criminality, with some crimes decreasing and others increasing, which makes it difficult to conclude that he is both right and wrong on this issue.\n",
            "fake - The premise describes a specific law and its provisions regarding the allocation of incremental revenues from the excise tax on tobacco products, including support for displaced workers. However, Marcos' statement during the CNN vice presidential debate does not mention this specific law or its provisions, but rather makes a general claim about the impact of increasing \"sin taxes\" on production and livelihoods in affected industries.\n",
            "fact - The premise directly states that \"fifteen percent (15%) of the incremental revenue collected from the excise tax on tobacco products under r. a. no. 8240 shall be allocated and divided among the provinces producing burley and native tobacco in accordance with the volume of tobacco leaf production\" and also mentions the appropriation of financial support for displaced workers in the alcohol and tobacco industries for years 2014 to 2017.\n",
            "fake - The premise does not mention anything about the total capacity of wind and hydro energy in Mindanao or the Philippines as a whole. It only provides specific targets for solar, wind, and hydro energy by 2030, and mentions pending renewable energy projects in Mindanao with a potential capacity of 2,998.09 megawatts by 2020, but not specifically for wind and hydro. The hypothesis claims that the total capacity of wind energy is 70,000 megawatts and hydro at least 30,000 megawatts in Mindanao alone, which is not supported by the premise.\n",

This contradicts the information provided in the premise.\n",

            "fake - The premise provides data on the poverty gap, severity of poverty, and poverty incidence in Sorsogon and Capiz, but it does not directly relate these statistics to the performance or actions of candidates Mar Roxas and Chiz Escudero. The statements made by the two politicians about each other's performance for their respective home provinces are subjective claims that cannot be verified based on the provided data alone.\n",

In his interview with President Joko Widodo, Pacquiao begs for clemency and asks to spare Mary Jane Veloso's life, which aligns with his stated pro-life conviction. This is in direct contradiction to the premise that he wants the death penalty despite being pro-life.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that Pacquiao prayed for Mary Jane Veloso to be spared from execution in Indonesia, which contradicts his statement in the senate session that \"death penalty is lawful\" and that God is a god of justice. This inconsistency suggests that Pacquiao's stance on the death penalty may not be consistent with his previous actions or words.\n",
            "fake - The premise does not entail the hypothesis because Alvarez and Abella have different quotes regarding President Duterte's preference for revising the constitution. Alvarez suggests that President Duterte might favor a Constitutional Convention (Con-Con) but also mentions the need to get consensus from Congress on the mode of revision, implying that President Duterte has not made up his mind yet. On the other hand, Abella states that President Duterte favors Con-Con over Con-Ass, which contradicts Alvarez's quote and suggests that President Duterte has indeed flip-flopped on how he wants it done.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that Duterte initially favored a Constitutional Convention (Con-Con) over a Constitutional Assembly (Con-Ass), but later changed his mind due to budgetary concerns. However, the hypothesis suggests that Duterte's speech on August 3, 2016, and Alvarez's briefing on July 28, 2016, indicate that he actually wanted a Con-Ass from the start, and only later decided against it due to cost considerations. This contradicts the premise's claim of an initial preference for Con-Con.\n",
            "fake - The premise describes Duterte as being open to talking to Abu Sayyaf, but later stating there's no reason to sit down and talk with criminals, which contradicts his initial statement of openness to dialogue.\n",
            "fake - The premise and hypothesis are about Duterte's stance on talking to Abu Sayyaf, but they contradict each other in terms of his willingness to engage in talks with the group. In the premise, it is stated that Duterte expressed openness to talking to Abu Sayyaf shortly after being elected, while in the hypothesis, it is claimed that he explicitly ruled out talks with them on August 1, 2016.\n",
            "fake - The premise describes a specific quote from Duterte's speech on Jan 14, where he mentions being charged with acts of lasciviousness and justifying his actions by saying the woman was very beautiful. However, the hypothesis presents an exchange between Duterte and Mike Enriquez during a presidential debate on Feb 21, where Duterte denies having any case for acts of lasciviousness and instead talks about having a girlfriend. The two statements contradict each other, as they present different accounts from Duterte regarding the same incident.\n",
            "fake - The premise only mentions that Duterte made a statement about being charged with acts of lasciviousness, but it does not confirm whether this statement referred to a specific incident or a general claim. The quote provided by the premise is also a response to a hypothetical situation where one might die if they don't touch a very beautiful woman, which doesn't necessarily imply that Duterte was actually charged with such an act in real life.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that Vice President-elect Sara Duterte said she would continue to reside in her hometown and only work in Metro Manila, which is consistent with the hypothesis's claim that ABS-CBN posted this news before the inauguration of Vice President Sara Duterte as a setup to mislead public opinion. However, the premise does not provide any information about the timing of the post or whether it was indeed incomplete, so there is no evidence to support the hypothesis's claims of malice.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that Vice President-elect Sara Duterte will continue to reside in her hometown (Davao City) and only work in Metro Manila, which implies that she will not be commuting daily between Davao and Manila.

However, the hypothesis mentions a different president, Maria Corazon Cojuangco Aquino, and her approval of large projects that favored Chinese businessmen, which contradicts the information in the premise about President Marcos' administration.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that there is a law (Presidential Decree No. 442 or the Labor Code of the Philippines) that allows contractualization, which directly contradicts Matula's statement that he did not encounter any law on contractualization during Cory Aquino's time.\n",

The premise suggests that Robredo is announcing a new initiative to continue volunteerism from his campaign, while the hypothesis implies that he is forming an alliance with communist groups to establish a new government, which contradicts the premise's tone of unity and cooperation.\n",

It also mentions the \"new generation currency\" series, which includes coins other than the P500 denomination.\n",
            "fact - The premise explicitly states that two designs featuring a Philippine eagle were made for the P500 coin, and mentions the sale of the [P500 coin] alongside other commemorative coins in January 2020, which directly supports the hypothesis about the issuance of P500 coins with an eagle design in 2020.\n",
            "fake - The premise states that Francisco debunked product endorsements falsely associated with him, including those of another collagen gummy product and a barley grass powder brand, implying that he is not affiliated with any such products.

Furthermore, it mentions the 2023 bilateral defense guidelines between the Philippines and the US, which invokes Article V of the MDT in case of an armed attack on either nation's coast guards, including those in the South China Sea.

            "fake - The premise implies that US troops visited Dibacong Fish Harbor as part of Balikatan 2023, suggesting a military presence in the Philippines. This contradicts the hypothesis that the US did not deploy hundreds of containers of missiles and military vehicles to the Philippines.\n",
            "fake - The premise does not provide any information about a video showing a fleet of ships with U.S., UK, and French flags. It only mentions specific instances of individual warships from each country being in the Philippine Sea or Manila Bay, but there is no mention of a video or a fleet of ships together.\n",
            "fake - The premise does not provide any information about ships participating in a joint exercise, but rather mentions separate events: CVN-72's documentation, a British warship's visit to Manila Bay, and a French destroyer's port visit. There is no indication of international cooperation or participation in an exercise.\n",

In fact, the premise implies the opposite, as it mentions that Clear Sight Eye Drops is not their official endorsement.\n",
        "fake - The premise does not mention Doc Liza Ong mentioning or not mentioning Clear Sight Eye Drops. It only mentions that the product is not registered and that Willie Ong stated their only official endorsement is Birch Tree Advance.\n",
        "fake - The premise states that the ad consists of spliced videos with AI-generated audio, indicating that Dr. Willie Ong's endorsement of the product is fabricated. Additionally, the premise does not mention Dr. Ong using the product to cure an illness, but rather discusses the importance of regular bowel and urinary movements in the original video.\n",
        "fact - The premise states that the ad consists of spliced videos with some portions replaced with AI-generated audio to make it seem that Ong mentioned the product, which directly supports the hypothesis that the ad removed parts of Ong's original voice recording and replaced it with AI-generated audio of him promoting the product.\n",
        "fake - The premise states that the Facebook page \"Public Health Malaysia\" is not affiliated with the Malaysian Health Ministry or the government, and the Ministry has clarified that statements cited in an article were not issued or authorized by them. This implies that any statement or post from the page, including the one mentioned in the hypothesis, cannot be attributed to the Malaysian government.\n",
        "fake - The premise does not mention Koreaboo editing its original article. It only mentions the Malaysian Health Ministry clarifying the statements cited in the article were not issued or authorized by the Malaysian government, via its official X account, and quoting the Koreaboo article.\n",
        "fake - The premise states that the media outlets (ABS-CBN, TV5, and GMA) have news reports on Pulse Asia's September survey, including articles and clips from various episodes, which directly contradicts the hypothesis that they did not report the latest Pulse Asia survey.\n",
        "fact - The premise states that multiple media outlets (ABS-CBN, TV5, and GMA) reported on Pulse Asia's September survey, which showed Duterte having higher trust ratings than Marcos, contradicting the hypothesis that the media did not report on this survey.\n",
        "fake - Ayon sa premise, si Pangulong Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo ang pumirma sa National Service Training (NSTP) Act of 2001 noong Enero 2002, na naging dahilan upang maging boluntaryo ang ROTC, hindi si Pangulong Maria Corazon Cojuangco Aquino.\n",
        "fact - Hindi totoong naging boluntaryo ang ROTC noong termino ni Pangulong Corazon Aquino dahil ayon sa premise, lumipas pa ang mahigit isang dekada bago naging boluntaryo ang ROTC nang pirmahan ni Pangulong Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo noong Enero 2002 ang National Service Training (NSTP) Act of 2001. Ibig sabihin, naging boluntaryo ang ROTC sa termino ni Pangulong Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, hindi sa termino ni Pangulong Corazon Aquino.\n",
        "fake - Ang mga wage order na binanggit sa premise (Wage Order No. NCR-23 at Wage Order No. RBVI-26) ay nagpapakita ng ibang mga halaga ng minimum wage sa iba't ibang rehiyon (P570 sa NCR at P450 sa Western Visayas), na hindi tumutugma sa P820 na binanggit sa hypothesis.\n",
        "fake - Ang premise ay nagpapakita ng mga opisyal na pahayag ng pamahalaan tungkol sa pagtaas ng minimum wage sa National Capital Region (NCR) at Western Visayas, kung saan ayon sa Wage Order No. NCR-23 at RBVI-26, may mga itinakdang halaga para sa minimum na arawang sahod ng mga manggagawa sa iba't ibang sektor. Ito ay salungat sa pahayag na hindi aabot sa ganitong halaga ang inaprubahang umento sa minimum wage.\n",
        "fake - Ang pahayag ni Guanzon ay hindi direktang tumutukoy kay Leni Robredo bilang hindi well-educated. Sa katunayan, sinabi niya na silang lahat ay \"well-educated people\" na nagmumula sa \"very good families\", na hindi nagpapakita ng anumang pagtawag kay Leni Robredo bilang hindi well-educated.\n",
        "fact - Ang pahayag ni Guanzon ay nagpapakita na siya ay naniniwala na sila ay \"well-educated people\" at nagmula sa \"very good families\", na hindi nagpapahiwatig na sinabi niya na \"hindi well-educated\" si Vice President Leni Robredo.\n",
        "fake - Ang premise ay hindi nagpapakita ng anumang bilin ni Bro. Eli Soriano tungkol kay Joma, mga kakampink nito, o kung sino-sino ang hindi dapat iboto ng sambayanang Pilipino. Ang premise ay nagpapakita lamang ng pagsagot ni Soriano sa isang estudyante tungkol sa red-tagging at ang pagpapalaya ni dating Pangulong Corazon Aquino kay Sison.\n",
        "fake - Ang premise ay tungkol sa pagsagot ni Soriano sa isang estudyante patungkol sa red-tagging at binatikos niya ang pagpapalaya ni dating presidente Corazon Aquino kay Sison, ngunit hindi ito nagpapakita ng anumang impormasyon tungkol sa bilin ni Soriano sa kanyang mga tagasunod na huwag iboto ang mga \"kakampink\".\n",
        "fake - Ang premise ay nagsasabi na walang magkakatapat na oval sa likod at harap ng balota, ngunit ang hypothesis ay nagsasabi na kailangan pumili ng partylist na hindi tatapat sa president at vice sa harap, na nagpapahiwatig na may mga posisyon na magkakatapat sa likod at harap ng balota. Ito ay salungat sa pahayag na walang magkakatapat na oval.\n",
        "fact - Dahil walang magkakatapat na oval sa likod at harap ng balota, hindi maaaring tamaan ang pangalan ng ibang kandidato kung babakat ang shade mula sa likuran ng balota.\n",
        "fake - Ang premise ay nagsasabi na ang electoral protest ni Marcos laban kay Leni ay na-dismiss na ng Korte Suprema dahil hindi niya napatunayan ang mga alegasyon ng pandaraya laban kay Robredo. Ito ay sumasalungat sa hypothesis na si Leni ay isang fake vice president at si Bongbong Marcos ang tunay na nagwagi. Ang premise ay nagpapakita na walang sapat na ebidensiya para suportahan ang mga alegasyon ni Marcos, kaya hindi maaaring sabihin na si Leni ay hindi nagwagi nang patas.\n",
        "fact - Ayon sa desisyon ng Korte Suprema, bigo si Marcos na magbigay ng mga patunay sa kanyang mga alegasyon ng pandaraya laban kay Robredo, at lumabas pa sa resulta ng manual recount na tumaas ang boto para kay Robredo. Ito ay nagpapakita na walang katibayan ng pandaraya na ginawa ni Robredo laban kay Marcos.\n",
        "fake - Ang Public Attorney's Office (PAO) ay nasa ilalim ng Department of Justice, na bahagi ng executive branch, hindi judiciary. Kaya, hindi si Leni Robredo ay nakatrabaho sa judiciary bilang abogado ng PAO.\n",
        "fact - Ang pao ay nakakabit sa department of justice na sakop ng executive branch, kaya hindi ito sakop ng hudikatura (judiciary) na binubuo ng supreme court at lower courts.\n",
        "fake - The premise states that both Kaka Bag-ao and Leni Robredo were lawyers for the Sumilao farmers, but it does not imply that Leni Robredo was not involved or that Kaka Bag-ao handled the case alone for 20+ years.\n",
        "fact - Ang pahayag ni Governor Arlene \"Kaka\" Bag-ao ay nagpapatunay na si Leni Robredo ay naging abogado ng Sumilao farmers, na sinusuportahan din ng pahayag ni Atty. Marlon Manuel na nagsasabi na si Robredo ay isa sa mga abogado na tumulong sa kampanya ng Sumilao farmers.\n",
        "fact - Ang premise ay nagpapakita na may kaugnayan sa pagitan ng video post at ang artikulo ng The Manila Times pati na rin ang video clip ng interview ni Sotto sa SMNI News noong Marso 17, kaya't ang hypothesis ay nasusuportahan ng premise.\n",
        "fact - Dahil walang binanggit si Sotto tungkol kay Pangilinan sa buong interview, hindi niya sinabi na paparusahan si Pangilinan kung mapatunayang nakipagsabwatan sa Smartmatic.\n",
        "fake - Ang premise ay nagsasabi na wala sa anumang bahagi ng interview ni Boy Abunda ang nagpapakitang sinabi ito ng batang Marcos, samantala ang hypothesis ay nagsasabi ng isang direktang quote mula sa batang Marcos na si William Vincent Marcos. Ito ay isang pagkakasalungatan sa pagitan ng premise at hypothesis.\n",
        "fact - Ang pahayag na \"dating nalulong sa droga ang kaniyang ama\" ay hindi nabanggit sa interview ni Boy Abunda kay William Vincent Marcos, kaya mali at manipulado ang social media quote card.\n",
        "fake - The premise states that police officers can seek legal assistance from three government agencies and even hire private lawyers at the government's expense, which directly contradicts President Duterte's statement that the government does not provide lawyers to police who need legal assistance.\n",
        "fact - The premise states that the secretary of justice, chairman of the commission, or the chief of the PNP may authorize lawyers to provide legal assistance to PNP members facing charges related to their official duty, and also allows for private counsel to be provided at the government's expense, which aligns with the hypothesis that the PNP law directs these agencies to provide free legal assistance to police sued in conducting their duty.\n",
        "fake - The premise does not support the hypothesis that the rich prefer cocaine and heroin, while the poor prefer shabu. In fact, the premise states that \"shabu and marijuana is the preferred drug choice\" without any distinction between wealth classes, and that marijuana is the most widely used substance overall. Additionally, the premise notes that the highest prevalence of drug use was found in quintile 2 (not the poorest or richest quintile), which contradicts the hypothesis that the poor are the primary users of shabu.\n",
        "fact - According to the DDB survey, the highest prevalence of drug use was found in quintile 2, not quintile 1, which represents the poorest. This indicates that it is not the poorest of the poor that is most affected by drugs, contradicting President Rodrigo Duterte's statement.\n",
        "fake - The premise directly quotes President Rodrigo Duterte saying \"my order diyan is shoot to kill kayo\" and also mentions a \"shoot-on-sight\" order for a local official and his son, which contradicts the hypothesis that he never issued a \"shoot-to-kill\" order against drug suspects.\n",
        "fact - The statements from Duterte, such as \"wala ako pakialam diyan sa human rights\" (\"I don't care about human rights\") and his \"shoot to kill\" orders, indicate a disregard for human rights principles, which aligns with the UN High Commissioner's statement that Duterte displays a lack of understanding of human rights institutions and principles.\n",
        "fact - Ang p300 billion na nabayarang utang sa BSP ay bahagi lamang ng domestic debt ng Pilipinas at hindi katumbas ng total outstanding national government debt, kaya maaaring totoo na binayaran ang utang na ito bago umalis si Pangulong Duterte sa kanyang termino.\n",
        "fact - Ang p300 billion na nabayarang utang ay bahagi lamang ng domestic debt ng Pilipinas, na umabot sa P8.37 trillion nitong Enero, kaya hindi totoong wala nang utang ang Pilipinas.\n",
        "fact - According to the premise, the revised penal code indeed states that a convict who is not a habitual criminal shall be pardoned at the age of 70 if they have already served out their original sentence or when they complete it after reaching 70, unless their conduct makes them unworthy of clemency. This supports President Duterte's claim that he can be released due to his age, being 71.\n",
        "fact - The hypothesis is entailed by the premise as it aligns with Article 13 Section 2 of the Revised Penal Code, which states that age is a mitigating circumstance, not a justifying circumstance that exempts a person from criminal liability. Being 70 years old reduces the penalty but does not exempt the person from serving their sentence.\n",
        "fake - The premise discusses the president's immunity from suit, both within the Philippines and internationally, while the hypothesis is a quote from President Duterte regarding his stance on dealing with criminals and drug addicts, and does not directly relate to the concept of immunity from suit.\n",
        "fact - The premise states that the International Criminal Court (ICC) can hold the president criminally liable, and the Rome Statute (Article 27) does not recognize immunities or special procedural rules, which supports the hypothesis that state immunity granted to a sitting president is not an effective shield against the ICC.\n",
        "fact - The premise and hypothesis both mention the same incident where Duterte stated he would \"gladly kill\" David Bangayan if he caught him smuggling rice in Davao, which De Lima found disturbing and against the rule of law. This shared information confirms that the premise entails the hypothesis.\n",
        "fact - The premise directly supports the hypothesis as it quotes De Lima saying she finds Duterte's statement \"disturbing\" and emphasizes the importance of following the \"rule of law\", but does not mention bringing Duterte to court.\n",
        "fact - The premise entails the hypothesis because the premise mentions that twelve government and police officials from Iloilo made it to the list of the Philippine National Police's narco-politicians, and the hypothesis specifically lists some individuals from Iloilo who are presumably those officials mentioned in the premise.\n",
        "fact - According to the premise, Iloilo province ranked 79th and Iloilo city ranked 51st in terms of the number of drug-affected barangays, which does not support the claim that Iloilo is the province or city where the use of shabu is most prevalent.\n",
        "fake - The hypothesis states that China and Russia have a flat tax system, but the premise contradicts this by stating that China practices progressive taxation, while only Russia has a flat tax rate of 13 percent.\n",
        "fact - The premise directly states that Russia imposes a flat tax rate of 13 percent on personal income, while China practices progressive taxation, confirming the hypothesis.\n",
        "fake - Ang premise ay nagsasabi na ang hand sign na ginawa nina Robredo at Pangilinan ay \"I love you\" na galing sa American Sign Language, samantala ang hypothesis ay nagsasabi na ito ay \"devils horn\" na isang magkaibang simbolo. Walang koneksyon sa pagitan ng dalawang simbolo, kaya hindi nagtutugma ang premise at hypothesis.\n",
        "fact - Ang premise ay nagpapakita na ang hand sign na ginawa nina Robredo at Pangilinan ay kumakatawan sa \"I love you\" sa American Sign Language, na madalas ginagamit para sa deaf and mute community, kaya hindi ito simbolo ng demonyo.\n",
        "fake - The premise states Indonesia's 2014 national energy policy aims to raise coal's contribution to 30 percent by 2025, and it also mentions that in 2013, petroleum accounted for the highest portion of Indonesia's energy mix at 38 percent. There is no information in the premise that supports Indonesia's energy mix being 80 percent coal.\n",
        "fact - The premise states that in 2013, petroleum accounted for the highest portion of Indonesia's energy mix at 38 percent, and the goal is to raise coal's contribution to 30 percent by 2025. This information implies that coal does not account for 80 percent of Indonesia's energy mix, supporting the hypothesis.\n",
        "fake - The premise does not support the hypothesis that criminality, illegal drugs, and poverty are all worsening. According to the premise, poverty incidence decreased from 27.9% in 2012 to 26.3% in 2015. Additionally, some crimes such as murder, homicide, and physical injury cases, as well as crimes versus property, have decreased. While there are some increases in certain crimes, the overall trend is not entirely worsening as stated in the hypothesis. The only clear increase is in drug use, with a 34% rise in admission cases.\n",
        "fact - The premise provides statistics that support Cayetano being right on the issue of drugs (34% increase in admission cases), wrong on poverty (poverty incidence decreased from 27.9% to 26.3%), and both right and wrong on criminality (some crimes like murder and robbery decreased, while others like rape and homicide increased).\n",
        "fake - The premise actually states that 15% of the incremental revenue collected from the excise tax on tobacco products will be allocated to programs that support tobacco farmers and workers, such as providing financial support, training, and alternative livelihood projects, which contradicts Marcos' claim that the \"sin tax\" law has nothing to offer those from the affected industries.\n",
        "fact - The premise explicitly states that 15% of the incremental revenue collected from the excise tax on tobacco products will be allocated to fund various programs in tobacco-producing provinces, and also provides for special financial support for displaced workers in the alcohol and tobacco industries from 2014 to 2017.\n",
        "fake - The hypothesis states that wind energy has a potential of 70,000 megawatts and hydro has at least 30,000 megawatts in Mindanao, but the premise reports a wind energy installation capacity target of 2,378 megawatts by 2030 and a potential capacity of pending hydro projects in Mindanao of 2,147.71 megawatts by 2020, which are significantly lower than the stated potentials in the hypothesis.\n",
        "fact - The hypothesis is supported by the premise as it provides specific government data on renewable energy targets (e.g., solar energy installation capacity target by 2030 is at 285 megawatts; wind, 2,378 megawatts; and hydro, 8,724.1 megawatts) which can be compared to Poe's mentioned numbers to determine if they are indeed \"way off\".\n",
        "fact - The hypothesis matches the premise from NEDA data as of Nov. 15, 2015: 1. 112,574 housing units not yet started + 79,219 on-going = 191,793, which is close to 154,000 (discrepancy might be due to ongoing units almost completed) 2. 305 classrooms not yet started + 54 under procurement = 359, which is close to 250 (discrepancy might be due to almost completed procurements or ongoing units not counted) 3. 44,466 coconut areas not yet started hectares is close to 40,000 hectares that need to be replanted.\n",
        "fake - The premise provides information about the NEDA data as of Nov. 15, 2015, but it does not mention Poe's Yolanda numbers, so there is no basis for comparison to determine if they tally or not.\n",
        "fact - The hypothesis states that Singapore has 4 million people, which is close to the actual number of residents (3.9 million) mentioned in the premise, and the statement uses this information to make a point about Singapore's defense capabilities.\n",
        "fake - The premise does not provide any information about Poe's figure, so we cannot determine if her figure was the closest or not.\n",
        "fake - The premise describes El Niño as a \"complex and naturally occurring weather pattern\" that occurs every 2-7 years, whereas the hypothesis states that El Niño is climate change. The premise also mentions that the link between climate change and El Niño is uncertain and hard to observe, contradicting the hypothesis' claim that El Niño is equivalent to climate change.\n",
        "fact - The premise from the Yale University and Columbia University articles describes El Niño as a \"complex and naturally occurring weather pattern\" that typically occurs every two to seven years, supporting the hypothesis that El Niño is a natural occurrence.\n",
        "fake - The premise states that before the law (RA 10533) was passed in 2013, the Philippines was one of the three remaining countries in the world with a 10-year pre-university education system, whereas the hypothesis states the Philippines is one of the remaining five countries without a K to 12 education system, which is a contradictory claim.\n",
        "fact - The premise directly states that before the law was passed, the Philippines was one of the three remaining countries in the world with a 10-year pre-university education system, which supports the hypothesis.\n",
        "fake - The premise provides data on poverty in Sorsogon and Capiz in 2012, but it does not provide information about the efforts of Mar Roxas and Chiz Escudero to address poverty in their respective home provinces during their time in office. Therefore, it cannot be determined if the accusations made by the candidates are valid or not.\n",
        "fact - According to the given premise, in 2012, Sorsogon had a higher poverty gap (7.4 vs 5.5), higher severity of poverty (2.5 vs 2), and higher poverty incidence among population (40.7% vs 27.8%) compared to Capiz. Additionally, Sorsogon ranked higher (worse) in all three categories among the 81 provinces. This supports the hypothesis that poverty-wise, Sorsogon is worse off than Capiz, at least for the year 2012. However, since the premise only provides data for 2012, we can infer that if the same trend holds for 2006 and 2009, the hypothesis would be true.\n",
        "fake - According to the premise, the Philippines was the top coconut producer in the 1960s and 1970s, and ranked second in most years since 1984, which contradicts Senator Poe's statement that the Philippines is the fifth largest coconut producer in the world.\n",
        "fact - The premise states the Philippines was the top coconut producer for most of the 1960s and 1970s, then ranked second since 1984, which implies the Philippines was never mentioned as the fifth largest coconut producer, making it possible for Sri Lanka to hold that position.\n",
        "fact - The hypothesis provides direct quotes from Manny Pacquiao that support the premise's claims about his pro-life stance and his efforts to save Mary Jane Veloso from execution, which contrasts with his later push for the reinstatement of the death penalty.\n",
        "fact - The premise and hypothesis both state that in his first privilege speech as a senator, Manny Pacquiao pushed for the reinstatement of the death penalty, specifically mentioning that it is for heinous crimes such as drug trafficking. The hypothesis provides a direct quote from Pacquiao's speech, which aligns with the information presented in the premise.\n",
        "fact - The premise and hypothesis both state that President Duterte initially favored a Constitutional Convention (Con-Con) over a Constitutional Assembly (Con-Ass) to revise the constitution, which shows consistency and supports the hypothesis.\n",
        "fact - The premise and hypothesis both state that President Duterte initially favored a Constitutional Convention (Con-Con) but later changed his mind due to budgetary concerns and a softening toward members of Congress, which is consistent with the information provided in both statements.\n",
        "fake - The premise does not mention Duterte blaming the United States and other Western countries for importing terrorism, nor does it mention him talking about colonial powers dividing Muslims and Christians. The premise only discusses Duterte's conflicting statements about whether to negotiate with the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) or not.\n",
        "fact - The hypothesis is directly supported by the information in the premise, specifically the quote from Duterte on August 1, where he describes the Abu Sayyaf Group as \"criminals\" and states that there is no reason for him to sit down and talk with them. This matches the statement in the hypothesis, where Duterte says he will not deal with the Abu Sayyaf Group because they are \"criminals\" and exhibit \"extreme brutality\".\n",
        "fact - Duterte initially mentioned being charged with acts of lasciviousness in his speech to the Rotarians, but later denied it when questioned by Mike Enriquez during the presidential debate, indicating a contradiction in his statements, thus the hypothesis is entailed as it shows Duterte's denial of the charge.\n",

Ang premise ay nagbibigay ng impormasyon tungkol sa mga kapangyarihan ng pangulo at ng senado, ngunit hindi ito nagbibigay ng dahilan kung bakit si Gadon ang dapat na maupong senador.\n",
        "fact - Hindi pwede magtanggal ang pangulo ng isang senador sa pwesto at magtalaga ng kapalit nito ayon sa saligang batas. Ang kapangyarihang magpatalsik ng mga miyembro ng senado ay nasa senado lamang, at hindi kasama ang mga senador sa mga posisyon na maaaring italaga ng pangulo.\n",

Samantala, ang hypothesis ay nagsasabi na si dating Pangulong Maria Corazon Cojuangco Aquino ang nag-approve ng kontraktuwalisasyon, na salungat sa sinabi sa premise.\n",
        "fact - Ang pahayag ni Atty. Jose Sonny Matula ay sumang-ayon sa premise na walang batas na naipasa noong panahon ni Pangulong Cory Aquino tungkol sa kontraktuwalisasyon, dahil ang batas na nagbigay-daan sa kontraktuwalisasyon ay naipasa noong panahon ni Pangulong Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr. noong Mayo 1, 1974.\n",

        "fact - Ang premise ay nagpapakita na si Robredo ay nag-anunsyo ng pagtatatag ng \"Angat Buhay NGO\", na isang organisasyon na magpapatuloy sa bolunterismo ng kanyang mga taga-suporta. Ito ay hindi nagpapakita ng anumang koneksyon sa Communist Party of the Philippines o New People's Army, o sa pagtatatag ng isang \"new government\". Kaya, ang premise ay sumusuporta sa pahayag na walang sinabi si Robredo tungkol sa pagtatatag ng \"Angat Buhay Alliance\" kasama ang mga grupong ito.\n",

        "fact - Ang pahayag ni Dr. Jean Encinas-Franco ay nagpapakita na siya ay aktibong faculty pa rin sa University of the Philippines at kasalukuyang nasa sabbatical leave, na sumasalungat sa ideya na siya ay napatalsik.\n",
        "fake - The premise states that the modernization project of the Davao International Airport was taken back by the implementing agency in February 2023, and the Leyte-Surigao link bridge was marked \"for possible delisting\" in July 2019 and later confirmed to be no longer pushing through. This contradicts the hypothesis that these projects are part of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s \"Build Better More\" program.\n",
        "fact - The premise states that the modernization project of the Davao International Airport was included in NEDA's IFP list only until May 2021 and was later taken back by the implementing agency. Additionally, it mentions that the Leyte-Surigao link bridge was marked \"for possible delisting\" in 2019 and the then NEDA chief Ernesto Pernia stated that the project would no longer push through due to high costs and challenges. This information supports the hypothesis that the most recent list of IFPs does not include these two projects.\n",
        "fact - The premise mentions the announcement of the sale of a P500 coin by the BSP in January 2020, which directly supports the hypothesis of a new 500 peso coin.\n",
        "fact - The premise states that the BSP announced the sale of the P500 coin with an eagle design in January 2020 to celebrate 70 years of central banking and the BSP's 25th anniversary, which supports the hypothesis that the BSP issued P500 coins with an eagle design in 2020 as part of its commemorative currency. Additionally, the premise mentions that the BSP's list of public advisories starting from 2020 does not contain any information about new coins aside from the \"New Generation Currency\" series, which implies that no such coins were released recently for circulation.\n",
        "fact - The hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it provides a specific example of a product endorsement (glutathione collagen gummies) that may be falsely associated with Francisco, which he warned against in his YouTube video.\n",
        "fact - The premise states that Francisco debunked product endorsements falsely associated with him, including those of another collagen gummy product, and reminded the public to be wary of fake products. This, combined with the information that \"glutathione collagen gummies\" is not listed by the FDA, supports the hypothesis that Francisco does not endorse the unregistered brand of collagen gummies.\n",
        "fact - The premise does not directly state the hypothesis, but it provides information that makes the hypothesis plausible. The premise states that Ong only endorses one product, Birch Tree Advance, and that \"Fitgum\" and its product \"Apple Cider Vinegar Gummies\" are not registered. This information suggests that Ong would not endorse \"Fitgum\" products, making it likely that any picture of him with such a product would be doctored.\n",
        "fact - The premise states that Ong only endorses one product, \"Birch Tree Advance\", and that \"Fitgum\" and \"Apple Cider Vinegar Gummies\" do not have a certificate of product registration. This information supports the hypothesis that Dr. Ong (and possibly Dr. Liza Ong) has been misrepresented as an endorser of the unregistered \"Apple Cider Vinegar Gummies\".\n",
        "fake - The premise states that the purchase of the anti-ship missile system happened before Marcos took office in mid-2022, specifically on December 31, 2021, and the contract was for three batteries of the system, but it does not mention the exact number of missiles as 100. Additionally, it does not attribute the purchase to the Marcos administration, but rather to the Department of National Defense before Marcos took office.\n",
        "fact - The premise states that the purchase happened before Marcos took office in mid-2022, and the contract agreement was signed and notice to proceed was issued in January and February 2022, respectively, which was during the administration of former President Rodrigo Duterte.\n",
        "fake - The premise states that Kris Aquino commented on Kim Chiu's Instagram post on Jan. 3, indicating that she was alive on that date, which contradicts the hypothesis that she died on the same day.\n",
        "fact - The premise states that Aquino commented on Kim Chiu's Instagram post on Jan. 3, which directly supports the hypothesis that she is alive and was active on social media, contradicting the rumors of her death.\n",
        "fake - The premise only mentions that the verified badge is on \"Doc Willie Ong's\" official page, but the hypothesis mentions it's the official fanpage of \"Doc Willie & Lizza Ong\". The premise does not confirm Lizza Ong as a co-owner of the page.\n",
        "fake - The premise is neutral to the hypothesis as it provides information about the authentic page of Doc Willie Ong, but it does not directly relate to or contradict the information about the imposter page.\n",
        "fake - The premise does not support the hypothesis. In fact, it contradicts the hypothesis as Ong clarified that Birch Tree Advance is the only product he endorses, but the hypothesis is promoting a different product, \"Navitas Pure Organic Barley\" (implied, as the hypothesis is about organic barley), which is also mentioned in the premise as not having a certificate of product registration with the FDA.\n",
        "fact - The premise states that Ong only endorses Birch Tree Advance, and the FDA's portal shows that \"Navitas Pure Organic Barley\" does not have a certificate of product registration. This information supports the hypothesis that the sponsored post was manipulated to make it seem like Ong is endorsing \"Navitas Pure Organic Barley\", which is not the product he actually endorses.\n",
        "fake - The premise states that Robredo accepted the results of the election in her \"Tayo Ang Liwanag\" thanksgiving speech and acknowledged the majority's decision. Although she mentioned questions about the honesty of the election's conduct and reports of irregularities, she did not explicitly state that the election was not clean, honest, or transparent, nor did she say that she never conceded the election. This directly contradicts the claim made in the hypothesis.\n",
        "fact - The premise states that Robredo accepted the results of the election in her \"Tayo Ang Liwanag\" thanksgiving speech, but also mentioned that her team was monitoring allegations and consulting with experts regarding the honesty of the election's conduct. However, it does not indicate that she denied conceding the election. Instead, her speeches show that she acknowledged the results while expressing disappointment and concerns about reported irregularities. This implies that any quote claiming she denied conceding the election would be fabricated.\n",
        "fake - The premise states that NAIA was no longer included in the global list of worst airports in 2015 after multiple renovations and improvements led by the Department of Transportation and Communications under Aquino's presidency, and it also improved in 2018 as the 10th most improved airport in the world under Duterte's presidency, but then worsened again in 2022 and 2024. This contradicts the hypothesis that NAIA only improved during Duterte's time.\n",
        "fake - The premise does not mention NAIA being named the world's worst airport during the term of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. It was named the third most stressful in Asia and the fourth worst airport in Asia for business travel during his term, but not the world's worst. Additionally, during Duterte's term, NAIA was named the worst in the world, but specifically for business class travelers, not overall.\n",
        "fake - The premise states that Singapore's president has six-year terms, and its parliament is convened every five years, but this does not necessarily mean that the term of government officials in Singapore is five years as stated by Padilla. Additionally, the premise lists several countries in Southeast Asia that still impose term limits, contradicting Padilla's claim that the Philippines is the only country left with term limits.\n",
        "fact - The premise states that eight out of 11 southeast Asian countries impose term limits, which is a clear majority, supporting the hypothesis that the majority of southeast Asian countries impose term limits on their government officials.\n",
        "fake - The premise states that Kissinger's document was written in 1975 and does not represent the current U.S. policy on the MDT, as many things have changed since then, including the 2016 ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration and the 2023 bilateral defense guidelines between the Philippines and the U.S. This contradicts Roque's claim that Kissinger's document is still applicable to the current situation.\n",
        "fact - The premise states that the Philippines and the U.S. reinforced their commitments through a bilateral defense guidelines in May 2023, which includes invoking the articles IV and V of the MDT in case of aggression in the Pacific, including the South China Sea. This implies that the MDT extends to the escalating Chinese aggression in the West Philippine Sea. Additionally, Article V of the MDT qualifies an \"armed attack\" to include attacks on island territories under the jurisdiction of either party in the Pacific Ocean, which supports the hypothesis.\n",
        "fake - The premise states that the PhilHealth premium rose to 5% last Jan. 1 and has been in effect, and also mentions a scheduled increase as per the Universal Health Care Law and a circular issued in 2019. This directly contradicts the hypothesis, where it is stated that there was no increase in the premium.\n",
        "fact - The premise clearly states that the PhilHealth premium rose to 5% last Jan. 1 and has been in effect, as mandated by the Universal Health Care Law and implemented through PhilHealth Circular No. 2019-0009 and PhilHealth Regional Office NCR Advisory No. 2024-002.

This directly contradicts Beijing's claim that the BRP Sierra Madre was \"illegally grounded\" in Ayungin Shoal, as the Philippines has the right to operate ships in the area according to the UNCLOS.\n",
        "fact - The premise directly states that the Permanent Arbitration Court at The Hague declared Ayungin Shoal to be within the EEZ and continental shelf of the Philippines, which aligns with the hypothesis that Ayungin Shoal falls within the Philippines' EEZ, providing a legal basis for the presence of the warship BRP Sierra Madre in the area.\n",

        "fact - Although the premise does not mention the specific date (May 15) and location (Panatag Shoal), it does state that the mission is peaceful, based on international law, and aimed at asserting sovereign rights, which matches the hypothesis. The premise also mentions a fleet of 100 small boats, which corresponds to the 100-boat convoy in the hypothesis.\n",

        "fake - The premise states that the only ceremonial turnover between the Philippines and Japan in 2024 was for the TPS-P14ME mobile air surveillance radar system, contradicting the hypothesis that there was a handover ceremony for T-4 combat training aircraft.\n",
        "fact - The premise mentions the Philippines receiving a radar system from Japan as part of the AFP modernization program, but it does not mention anything about the Philippine Air Force receiving or operating T-4 fighter jets from Japan. The absence of information about the T-4 fighter jets, combined with the specific mention of the radar system, implies that the premise does not contradict the hypothesis, and the hypothesis can be considered true based on the given information.\n",

In fact, the premise states that \"shabu and marijuana is the preferred drug choice\" without any distinction between wealth classes, and that marijuana is the most widely used substance overall. Additionally, the premise notes that the highest prevalence of drug use was found in quintile 2 (not the poorest or richest quintile), which contradicts the hypothesis that the poor are the primary users of shabu.\n",

This supports President Duterte's claim that he can be released due to his age, being 71.\n",

            "42 fact - The premise entails the hypothesis because the premise mentions that twelve government and police officials from Iloilo made it to the list of the Philippine National Police's narco-politicians, and the hypothesis specifically lists some individuals from Iloilo who are presumably those officials mentioned in the premise.\n",

While there are some increases in certain crimes, the overall trend is not entirely worsening as stated in the hypothesis. The only clear increase is in drug use, with a 34% rise in admission cases.\n",

            "64 fake - The premise provides data on poverty in Sorsogon and Capiz in 2012, but it does not provide information about the efforts of Mar Roxas and Chiz Escudero to address poverty in their respective home provinces during their time in office.

Additionally, Sorsogon ranked higher (worse) in all three categories among the 81 provinces. This supports the hypothesis that poverty-wise, Sorsogon is worse off than Capiz, at least for the year 2012. However, since the premise only provides data for 2012, we can infer that if the same trend holds for 2006 and 2009, the hypothesis would be true.\n",

            "66 fake - According to the premise, the Philippines was the top coconut producer in the 1960s and 1970s, and ranked second in most years since 1984, which contradicts Senator Poe's statement that the Philippines is the fifth largest coconut producer in the world.\n",
            "\n",
            "67 fact - The premise states the Philippines was the top coconut producer for most of the 1960s and 1970s, then ranked second since 1984, which implies the Philippines was never mentioned as the fifth largest coconut producer, making it possible for Sri Lanka to hold that position.\n",

            "68 fact - The hypothesis provides direct quotes from Manny Pacquiao that support the premise's claims about his pro-life stance and his efforts to save Mary Jane Veloso from execution, which contrasts with his later push for the reinstatement of the death penalty.\n",

            "71 fact - The premise and hypothesis both state that President Duterte initially favored a Constitutional Convention (Con-Con) but later changed his mind due to budgetary concerns and a softening toward members of Congress, which is consistent with the information provided in both statements.\n",

This information supports the hypothesis that Dr. Ong (and possibly Dr. Liza Ong) has been misrepresented as an endorser of the unregistered \"Apple Cider Vinegar Gummies\".\n",
            "\n",
            "96 fake - The premise states that the purchase of the anti-ship missile system happened before Marcos took office in mid-2022, specifically on December 31, 2021, and the contract was for three batteries of the system, but it does not mention the exact number of missiles as 100. Additionally, it does not attribute the purchase to the Marcos administration, but rather to the Department of National Defense before Marcos took office.\n",
            "\n",
            "97 fact - The premise states that the purchase happened before Marcos took office in mid-2022, and the contract agreement was signed and notice to proceed was issued in January and February 2022, respectively, which was during the administration of former President Rodrigo Duterte.\n",
            "\n",
            "98 fake - The premise states that Kris Aquino commented on Kim Chiu's Instagram post on Jan. 3, indicating that she was alive on that date, which contradicts the hypothesis that she died on the same day.\n",
            "\n",
            "99 fact - The premise states that Aquino commented on Kim Chiu's Instagram post on Jan. 3, which directly supports the hypothesis that she is alive and was active on social media, contradicting the rumors of her death.\n",
            "\n",
            "100 fake - The premise only mentions that the verified badge is on \"Doc Willie Ong's\" official page, but the hypothesis mentions it's the official fanpage of \"Doc Willie & Lizza Ong\". The premise does not confirm Lizza Ong as a co-owner of the page.\n",
            "\n",
            "101 fake - The premise is neutral to the hypothesis as it provides information about the authentic page of Doc Willie Ong, but it does not directly relate to or contradict the information about the imposter page.\n",
            "\n",
            "102 fake - The premise does not support the hypothesis. In fact, it contradicts the hypothesis as Ong clarified that Birch Tree Advance is the only product he endorses, but the hypothesis is promoting a different product, \"Navitas Pure Organic Barley\" (implied, as the hypothesis is about organic barley), which is also mentioned in the premise as not having a certificate of product registration with the FDA.\n",
            "\n",
            "103 fact - The premise states that Ong only endorses Birch Tree Advance, and the FDA's portal shows that \"Navitas Pure Organic Barley\" does not have a certificate of product registration. This information supports the hypothesis that the sponsored post was manipulated to make it seem like Ong is endorsing \"Navitas Pure Organic Barley\", which is not the product he actually endorses.\n",

            "104 fake - The premise states that Robredo accepted the results of the election in her \"Tayo Ang Liwanag\" thanksgiving speech and acknowledged the majority's decision. Although she mentioned questions about the honesty of the election's conduct and reports of irregularities, she did not explicitly state that the election was not clean, honest, or transparent, nor did she say that she never conceded the election. This directly contradicts the claim made in the hypothesis.\n",
            "\n",
            "105 fact - The premise states that Robredo accepted the results of the election in her \"Tayo Ang Liwanag\" thanksgiving speech, but also mentioned that her team was monitoring allegations and consulting with experts regarding the honesty of the election's conduct. However, it does not indicate that she denied conceding the election. Instead, her speeches show that she acknowledged the results while expressing disappointment and concerns about reported irregularities. This implies that any quote claiming she denied conceding the election would be fabricated.\n",

            "106 fake - The premise states that NAIA was no longer included in the global list of worst airports in 2015 after multiple renovations and improvements led by the Department of Transportation and Communications under Aquino's presidency, and it also improved in 2018 as the 10th most improved airport in the world under Duterte's presidency, but then worsened again in 2022 and 2024. This contradicts the hypothesis that NAIA only improved during Duterte's time.\n",
            "\n",
            "107 fake - The premise does not mention NAIA being named the world's worst airport during the term of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. It was named the third most stressful in Asia and the fourth worst airport in Asia for business travel during his term, but not the world's worst. Additionally, during Duterte's term, NAIA was named the worst in the world, but specifically for business class travelers, not overall.\n",

            "108 fake - The premise states that Singapore's president has six-year terms, and its parliament is convened every five years, but this does not necessarily mean that the term of government officials in Singapore is five years as stated by Padilla. Additionally, the premise lists several countries in Southeast Asia that still impose term limits, contradicting Padilla's claim that the Philippines is the only country left with term limits.\n",
            "\n",
            "109 fact - The premise states that eight out of 11 southeast Asian countries impose term limits, which is a clear majority, supporting the hypothesis that the majority of southeast Asian countries impose term limits on their government officials.\n",

            "110 fake - The premise states that Kissinger's document was written in 1975 and does not represent the current U.S. policy on the MDT, as many things have changed since then, including the 2016 ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration and the 2023 bilateral defense guidelines between the Philippines and the U.S. This contradicts Roque's claim that Kissinger's document is still applicable to the current situation.\n",
            "\n",
            "111 fact - The premise states that the Philippines and the U.S. reinforced their commitments through a bilateral defense guidelines in May 2023, which includes invoking the articles IV and V of the MDT in case of aggression in the Pacific, including the South China Sea. This implies that the MDT extends to the escalating Chinese aggression in the West Philippine Sea. Additionally, Article V of the MDT qualifies an \"armed attack\" to include attacks on island territories under the jurisdiction of either party in the Pacific Ocean, which supports the hypothesis.\n",

            "112 fake - The premise states that the PhilHealth premium rose to 5% last Jan. 1 and has been in effect, and also mentions a scheduled increase as per the Universal Health Care Law and a circular issued in 2019. This directly contradicts the hypothesis, where it is stated that there was no increase in the premium.\n",
            "\n",
            "113 fact - The premise clearly states that the PhilHealth premium rose to 5% last Jan. 1 and has been in effect, as mandated by the Universal Health Care Law and implemented through PhilHealth Circular No. 2019-0009 and PhilHealth Regional Office NCR Advisory No. 2024-002. This directly supports the hypothesis that the contribution was raised to 5% in 2024.\n",

            "114 fake - The premise states that the Permanent Arbitration Court at The Hague declared Ayungin Shoal to be within the EEZ and continental shelf of the Philippines, giving the Philippines freedom to operate ships in the area. This directly contradicts Beijing's claim that the BRP Sierra Madre was \"illegally grounded\" in Ayungin Shoal, as the Philippines has the right to operate ships in the area according to the UNCLOS.\n",
            "\n",
            "115 fact - The premise directly states that the Permanent Arbitration Court at The Hague declared Ayungin Shoal to be within the EEZ and continental shelf of the Philippines, which aligns with the hypothesis that Ayungin Shoal falls within the Philippines' EEZ, providing a legal basis for the presence of the warship BRP Sierra Madre in the area.\n",

            "116 fake - The premise states that the mission of Atin Ito is peaceful, and their goal is to distribute food packs and fuel to Filipino fishermen, whereas the hypothesis describes a military confrontation involving U.S., Philippine, and Chinese vessels, which directly contradicts the peaceful nature of the mission described in the premise.\n",
            "\n",
            "117 fact - Although the premise does not mention the specific date (May 15) and location (Panatag Shoal), it does state that the mission is peaceful, based on international law, and aimed at asserting sovereign rights, which matches the hypothesis. The premise also mentions a fleet of 100 small boats, which corresponds to the 100-boat convoy in the hypothesis.\n",

            "119 fact - The premise states that there are no news reports or official statements about Sen. Imee Marcos' supposed resignation from the senate, and also mentions her recent statement as a senator, which implies that she is still part of the senate.\n",

            "120 fake - The premise does not mention a senator asking Guo to sing \"Lupang Hinirang\" and \"Bahay Kubo\" to prove her citizenship. It only states that Guo was at the hearing to prove her identity and that the hearing focused on verifying her citizenship and resolving discrepancies in her personal records.\n",
            "\n",
            "121 fact - Neutral cannot be concluded, but 'fact' can be concluded for a portion of the statement. \n",

            "123 fake - The premise states that the only ceremonial turnover between the Philippines and Japan in 2024 was for the TPS-P14ME mobile air surveillance radar system, contradicting the hypothesis that there was a handover ceremony for T-4 combat training aircraft.\n",
            "\n",
            "124 fact - The premise mentions the Philippines receiving a radar system from Japan as part of the AFP modernization program, but it does not mention anything about the Philippine Air Force receiving or operating T-4 fighter jets from Japan. The absence of information about the T-4 fighter jets, combined with the specific mention of the radar system, implies that the premise does not contradict the hypothesis, and the hypothesis can be considered true based on the given information.\n",
            "\n",
            "125 fake - The premise states the last known visit of US troops to the Dibacong Fish Harbor was on April 17, 2023, but the hypothesis claims a massive military shipment arrived at the same location on June 2, which is after the last known visit, making the hypothesis not directly supported by the premise.\n",

            "126 fake - The premise only mentions a specific visit of US troops to a location in the Philippines, but it does not provide information about the deployment of containers of missiles and military vehicles, so it cannot confirm or deny the hypothesis.\n",
